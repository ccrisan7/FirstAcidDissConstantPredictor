# Predicting First Acid Dissociation Constants Using Graph Neural Networks
**Predicting acid dissociation constants (pKa)** is critical for various applications, from drug design to environmental chemistry. Traditional methods have limitations, prompting the exploration of novel approaches like *graph neural networks* (GNNs).

The project starts with a *dataset of 2439 molecules with known pKa values* sourced from IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry). Each molecule is represented as a graph using its SMILES notation, encapsulating structural information. The model, a GNN tailored for graph data, learns from these molecular graphs and known pKa values to predict pKa accurately.

The objective is to develop a *scalable framework for pKa prediction*, beneficial for drug design, catalyst optimization, and environmental studies. By leveraging GNNs and comprehensive datasets, the aim is to expedite innovation in computational chemistry and related domains.
